# 🧠 **Technical Memory - Service Management & Booking Integration**

*Master Reference Document for Development Decisions and Implementation Details*

---

## 📋 **Document Purpose**

This document serves as the **comprehensive technical memory** for the PalHands project, capturing all critical implementation decisions, fixes, and architectural patterns discussed across development sessions. **READ THIS DOCUMENT FIRST** before making any changes to service management, availability, or booking systems.

## 🎯 **Current Focus: Service Management & Booking Integration (January 2025)**

### **Critical Issues RESOLVED**

#### **1. Global Slot Inheritance Logic (✅ FIXED)**
- **Problem**: Global slots were appearing as excluded (red) by default instead of active (blue)
- **Root Cause**: Circular logic issue in `_openServiceAvailabilityDialog` method
- **Solution**: Implemented smart exclusion detection:
  - **Services WITHOUT overrides**: All global slots = blue (active by default)  
  - **Services WITH overrides**: Only global slots present in saved schedule = blue, missing ones = restore section
- **Files Modified**: `my_services_widget.dart` lines 1443-1500
- **Result**: New global slots now appear as intended (blue/active) by default

#### **2. Emergency Mode Baseline Inheritance (✅ FIXED)**
- **Problem**: Emergency mode was inheriting from old global slots instead of service's effective normal schedule
- **Root Cause**: Emergency was using global baseline instead of service's current effective schedule
- **Solution**: Created dedicated `_EmergencyDayEditorRow` component that:
  - Shows baseline slots from normal mode as **non-removable gray dots**
  - Only allows adding/removing emergency-specific green slots
  - Saves only emergency additions, not baseline
- **Files Modified**: `my_services_widget.dart` lines 1890-2120
- **Result**: Emergency mode properly inherits from service's normal schedule

#### **3. Slot Exclusion Persistence (✅ FIXED)**
- **Problem**: User exclusions weren't persisting across dialog reopens
- **Root Cause**: Exclusions were being recalculated from saved data instead of preserving user intent
- **Solution**: Proper distinction between:
  - **Initial exclusions**: Based on saved service schedule vs global
  - **User exclusions**: Real-time changes during session
  - **Restore functionality**: Previously excluded slots can be re-activated
- **Files Modified**: `my_services_widget.dart` lines 1500-1600
- **Result**: User exclusions now persist correctly

#### **4. Dynamic Booking Rules (✅ FIXED)**
- **Problem**: Emergency mode bookings still enforced 48-hour delay
- **Root Cause**: Booking dialog wasn't checking emergency mode for date restrictions
- **Solution**: Modified `booking_dialog.dart` to allow:
  - **Normal mode**: 48-hour minimum delay
  - **Emergency mode**: Same-day booking allowed
- **Files Modified**: `booking_dialog.dart` lines 180-220
- **Result**: Emergency bookings now support same-day scheduling

#### **5. Circular Logic Resolution (✅ FIXED)**
- **Problem**: Endless loop between showing slots as blue vs excluded
- **Root Cause**: Inconsistent state management between display logic and save logic
- **Solution**: Established clear slot state hierarchy:
  1. **Blue slots**: Global inherited and active
  2. **Green slots**: Service-specific additions
  3. **Restore section**: Previously excluded global slots
- **Result**: No more circular behavior, consistent state across reopens

## 🏗️ **System Architecture Patterns**

### **Service Availability Inheritance Model**

```
┌─ Global Availability ────────────────────┐
│  Monday: 09:00-17:00                     │
│  Tuesday: 10:00-16:00                    │
└────────────────┬─────────────────────────┘
                 │ Inherits ↓
┌─ Service Normal Mode ────────────────────┐
│  = (Global - Exclusions) + Additions    │
│  Monday: 09:00-17:00 (blue inherited)   │
│  Tuesday: 10:00-16:00 (blue inherited)  │
│  Wednesday: 14:00-15:00 (green addition)│
└────────────────┬─────────────────────────┘
                 │ Inherits ↓
┌─ Service Emergency Mode ─────────────────┐
│  = Service Normal + Emergency Additions │
│  Monday: 09:00-17:00 (gray baseline)    │
│  Tuesday: 10:00-16:00 (gray baseline)   │
│  Wednesday: 14:00-15:00 (gray baseline) │
│  Thursday: 20:00-22:00 (green emergency)│
└──────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### **Slot Color Coding System**

- **🟦 Blue**: Global inherited slots (active by default)
- **🟩 Green**: Service-specific additions (normal or emergency)
- **⚫ Gray**: Read-only baseline slots in emergency mode
- **❌ Restore Section**: Previously excluded global slots (can be re-activated)

### **Save Logic Pattern**

```javascript
// Normal Mode Save
weeklyOverrides = (activeGlobalSlots + serviceAdditions) - userExclusions

// Emergency Mode Save  
emergencyWeeklyOverrides = emergencyAdditions only (baseline inherited automatically)

// Inheritance Check
if (effectiveSchedule === globalSchedule) {
  weeklyOverrides = null // Inherit fully
}
```

## 🔧 **Implementation Details**

### **Key Components**

#### **1. Service Availability Dialog (`_openServiceAvailabilityDialog`)**
- **Purpose**: Main entry point for service availability editing
- **Location**: `my_services_widget.dart` lines 1400-1500
- **Key Logic**:
  - Calculates service effective schedule for emergency baseline
  - Initializes exclusions based on saved overrides vs global
  - Handles both normal and emergency mode tabs

#### **2. Service Day Editor Row (`_ServiceDayEditorRow`)**
- **Purpose**: Renders normal mode availability per day
- **Location**: `my_services_widget.dart` lines 1600-1800
- **Key Features**:
  - Shows global slots as blue with ⊖ remove buttons
  - Shows service additions as green with ✕ remove buttons  
  - Shows restore section for previously excluded slots

#### **3. Emergency Day Editor Row (`_EmergencyDayEditorRow`)**
- **Purpose**: Renders emergency mode availability per day
- **Location**: `my_services_widget.dart` lines 1890-2120
- **Key Features**:
  - Shows baseline slots as gray read-only dots
  - Only allows adding/removing green emergency additions
  - No exclusion logic (everything inherits from normal)

#### **4. Dynamic Booking Dialog (`_selectDate`)**
- **Purpose**: Enforces different booking rules for normal vs emergency
- **Location**: `booking_dialog.dart` lines 180-220
- **Key Logic**:
  - Emergency mode: same-day booking allowed
  - Normal mode: 48-hour minimum delay

### **Database Schema Implications**

#### **Provider Service Document Structure**
```javascript
{
  provider: ObjectId,
  service: ObjectId,
  hourlyRate: Number,
  experienceYears: Number, 
  emergencyEnabled: Boolean,
  
  // Normal availability overrides
  weeklyOverrides: {
    monday: [{ start: "09:00", end: "10:00" }],
    // ... other days
  } | null, // null = inherit from global
  
  // Emergency availability additions
  emergencyWeeklyOverrides: {
    friday: [{ start: "20:00", end: "22:00" }],
    // ... emergency-specific slots only
  } | null
}
```

## 📚 **Development Guidelines**

### **BEFORE Making Changes**

1. **READ this entire document** to understand current implementation
2. **Check for related patterns** in existing code
3. **Verify inheritance logic** doesn't break with your changes
4. **Test both normal and emergency modes** thoroughly
5. **Ensure exclusions persist** across dialog reopens

### **Code Modification Rules**

#### **DO:**
- ✅ Follow established slot color coding system
- ✅ Preserve user exclusions across sessions
- ✅ Use service effective schedule as emergency baseline  
- ✅ Save `null` for overrides when inheriting fully
- ✅ Test edge cases (no overrides, mixed inheritance, full exclusion)

#### **DON'T:**
- ❌ Change global slots to affect individual services directly
- ❌ Show remove buttons on emergency baseline slots
- ❌ Mix global baseline with service baseline in emergency
- ❌ Allow emergency exclusions (everything inherits)
- ❌ Save empty objects instead of `null` for clean inheritance

### **Testing Checklist**

#### **Service Availability Testing**
- [ ] New global slot appears blue in all services
- [ ] User can exclude global slot (moves to restore section)
- [ ] Excluded slots persist after dialog reopen
- [ ] Service additions appear as green slots
- [ ] Save with no changes preserves inheritance (`null` overrides)

#### **Emergency Mode Testing**  
- [ ] Emergency shows service's effective normal schedule as baseline
- [ ] Baseline slots appear as gray dots (non-removable)
- [ ] Can add emergency-specific green slots
- [ ] Emergency additions persist after dialog reopen
- [ ] Normal schedule changes reflect in emergency baseline

#### **Booking Integration Testing**
- [ ] Normal mode enforces 48-hour delay
- [ ] Emergency mode allows same-day booking
- [ ] Calendar shows correct available dates based on mode
- [ ] Booking creation respects availability rules

## 🐛 **Known Issues & Workarounds**

### **Current Limitations**
1. **Emergency Baseline Refresh**: After changing normal schedule, emergency dialog must be reopened to see updated baseline
2. **Bulk Operations**: No bulk exclude/include functionality for multiple global slots
3. **Historical Data**: Legacy services may have inconsistent override structures

### **Future Enhancements**
1. **Real-time Baseline Updates**: Emergency mode should refresh when normal mode changes
2. **Bulk Toggle Features**: Select multiple slots for bulk operations  
3. **Availability Templates**: Pre-defined availability patterns for common schedules
4. **Conflict Detection**: Warn users about scheduling conflicts

## ⚠️ **CRITICAL REMINDERS**

### **For Future Developers**
1. **Emergency mode is NOT a separate schedule** - it's normal schedule + emergency additions + different booking rules
2. **Global slots are inherited by default** - exclusions are opt-in per service
3. **Save null, not empty objects** - this enables clean inheritance detection
4. **Test exclusion persistence** - this was the main circular logic issue
5. **Emergency baseline = service's effective normal** - not global directly

### **For AI/Assistant Developers**
1. **Read this document FIRST** before making availability-related changes
2. **Ask for clarification** if inheritance logic seems unclear
3. **Test all edge cases** mentioned in testing checklist
4. **Follow established patterns** - don't reinvent the inheritance model
5. **Update this document** when making architectural changes

## 🎯 **Quick Decision References**

**Q: Should new global slots appear as active or excluded by default?**  
A: **Active (blue)** - users can exclude if needed

**Q: What should emergency mode inherit from?**  
A: **Service's effective normal schedule** - not global directly

**Q: How to handle user exclusions across dialog reopens?**  
A: **Persist based on saved schedule comparison** - if global slot not in service schedule, it was excluded

**Q: Should emergency mode allow exclusions?**  
A: **No** - everything inherits, only additions allowed

**Q: When to save null vs empty object for overrides?**  
A: **Save null when fully inheriting** - enables clean inheritance detection

---

> **Remember**: This system prioritizes **inheritance by default** with **opt-in exclusions**. Emergency mode is **normal + additions + different booking rules**, not a separate schedule system.
