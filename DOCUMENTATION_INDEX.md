### **August 2025 - Responsive Navigation Unification (Final)**

#### **Responsive Design Problem Resolved**
1. **Documentation Alignment**
   - Updated to reflect a single, unified collapsed breakpoint strategy
   - Removed references to the temporary 771px–843px "problem range" approach
   - Keep TECHNICAL_MEMORY.md as historical notes (no further edits required)

2. **Shared Navigation Files Updated**
   - `frontend/lib/shared/widgets/shared_navigation.dart` (unified collapsed behavior, pill buttons, drawer auth actions)
   - `frontend/lib/shared/services/responsive_service.dart` (added `shouldCollapseNavigation(width) => width <= 950`)

#### **Key Fixes Implemented**
- **Status**: ✅ RESOLVED - Collapsed navigation is consistent and reliable
- **Unified Breakpoint**: Collapsed mode at screen width ≤ 950px
- **Solution Approach**: Single source of truth via `shouldCollapseNavigation` (no special-case ranges)
- **Implementation Details**:
  - Hamburger menu always opens the drawer at collapsed widths (works 771–947px and up to 950px)
  - Drawer includes Login and Signup actions in collapsed mode
  - Language/Login/Signup buttons unified as pill buttons in the top bar
