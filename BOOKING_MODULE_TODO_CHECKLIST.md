## 📋 Manual Testing Scenarios

### **Scenario 1: Provider Discovery & Service Selection**
**Goal**: Verify clients can browse services and see provider data

**Test Steps**:
1. **Login as Client**: Navigate to Services tab
2. **Select Category**: Choose "Home Cleaning" or "Babysitting"
3. **View Providers**: Verify provider data displays:
   - Provider name and photo
   - Experience (years)
   - Languages spoken
   - Hourly rate
   - Location (city/address)
   - Rating and review count
   - Services offered
4. **Provider Actions**: Verify buttons are functional:
   - Book Now (enabled)
   - Contact (enabled)
   - Chat (enabled)

**Expected Results**:
- Provider list shows real data from MongoDB
- No more mock/placeholder content
- All provider information is accurate and up-to-date

---

### **Scenario 2: Complete Booking Creation Flow**
**Goal**: Verify end-to-end booking creation with real data

**Test Steps**:
1. **Select Provider**: Choose a provider from the service list
2. **Click Book Now**: Navigate to booking creation form
3. **Fill Booking Details**:
   - Date and time selection
   - Address input
   - Additional notes
4. **Submit Booking**: Create the booking request
5. **Verify Backend Storage**: Check MongoDB for new booking record
6. **Check Client Dashboard**: Verify booking appears in "My Bookings"

**Expected Results**:
- Booking is stored in MongoDB with correct data
- Client dashboard shows new booking with "Pending" status

---

### **Scenario 3: Provider Dashboard Integration**
**Goal**: Verify providers can see and manage real bookings

**Test Steps**:
1. **Login as Provider**: Access provider dashboard
2. **Navigate to Bookings**: Check "Recent Bookings" section
3. **Verify Booking Display**: Confirm new booking appears with:
   - Client name
   - Service details
   - Date/time
   - Address
   - Current status (Pending)
4. **Test Status Updates**: Provider actions:
   - **Confirm**: Change status to "confirmed"
   - **Cancel**: Change status to "cancelled"
   - **Reschedule**: Update date/time (if implemented)

**Expected Results**:
- Provider sees real booking data from MongoDB
- Status changes are immediately reflected
- All booking details are accurate and complete

---

### **Scenario 4: Real-Time Status Synchronization**
**Goal**: Verify status changes sync between provider and client

**Test Steps**:
1. **Provider Updates Status**: Change booking status (e.g., "confirmed")
2. **Client Dashboard Check**: Verify status change appears immediately
3. **Status History**: Check that status changes are logged
4. **Multiple Updates**: Test various status transitions

**Expected Results**:
- Status changes appear in real-time on both dashboards
- Status history is maintained in MongoDB
- FSM rules are enforced (invalid transitions blocked)

---

### **Scenario 5: Data Integrity & Error Handling**
**Goal**: Verify system handles edge cases and maintains data consistency

**Test Steps**:
1. **Invalid Bookings**: Try to book with missing required fields
2. **Duplicate Bookings**: Test idempotency with same request
3. **Provider Deactivation**: Test booking behavior when provider becomes inactive
4. **Data Validation**: Verify all stored data matches input data

**Expected Results**:
- Validation errors prevent invalid bookings
- Idempotency prevents duplicate bookings
- Data consistency is maintained across all operations

## 🚨 **NEW BLOCKER: Provider Authentication Integration**

### **Status**: ⚠️ **BLOCKED** - Provider login not working

### **Issue Description**
While we successfully created 79 complete provider records with authentication credentials, **providers cannot currently log in** to test the booking flow end-to-end.

**Current State:**
- ✅ **79 providers seeded** with complete profiles and credentials
- ✅ **All provider data exists** in MongoDB `providers` collection
- ✅ **Email/password combinations** are correctly stored (e.g., `ahmed0@palhands.com` / `password123`)
- ❌ **Provider login fails** with "Incorrect email or password" error

### **Root Cause**
The authentication system is **not integrated with the Provider model**:
1. **Login endpoint** only checks the `users` collection
2. **Provider records** exist in separate `providers` collection
3. **Password verification** may not work on Provider model
4. **Provider login flow** not implemented

### **Required Fixes**
1. **Update authentication controller** to check both `users` and `providers` collections
2. **Ensure Provider model** has same password hashing/verification as User model
3. **Create provider login endpoint** or modify existing auth to handle provider role
4. **Test provider login** with seeded credentials

### **Impact on Booking Flow**
- ❌ **Cannot test provider dashboard** with real provider accounts
- ❌ **Cannot verify booking acceptance/rejection** by providers
- ❌ **End-to-end booking flow incomplete** until providers can login
- ❌ **Provider-side testing blocked**

### **Next Steps**
1. **Fix provider authentication** integration
2. **Test provider login** with seeded accounts
3. **Complete end-to-end booking flow testing**
4. **Mark Phase 3 as fully complete**
